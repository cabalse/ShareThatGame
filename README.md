# ShareThatGame
ShareThatGame is a client-side React application with a Node Express server that facilitates communication between gamemaster and players during a roleplaying session.

## Background
This application is an exploration in learning socket.io and to structure the communication (and code) between a client and server. Could have easily been a simple chat-application but wanted to do a little bit more.
If it ever get finished a bonus will be to use it in our game sessions :)

## Techniques
The client is built using CRA with Typescript. It uses socket.io, react-bootstrap (so far). For testing it uses jest, msv, testing-library, and socket.io-mock.

## The Excuse
Everything is a little but of a mess for the moment :) So if you have stumbled upon this it might not give you much. But check back if there is a interest!

Cheers!
